Patch Extraction Pipeline with Hardcoded Paths (PyTorch)
========================================================
- Loads real images (GeoTIFF) as torch.Tensor
- Extracts 32Ã—32 patches from two input images
- Produces arrays of patches (flattened columns)
- Produces ground truth patch medians
- Saves output to `.mat`
